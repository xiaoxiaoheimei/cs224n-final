The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.","question":"Who was famed for their Christian spirit?","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,18],[19,22],[23,24],[25,30],[31,40],[40,41],[42,50],[51,54],[55,63],[64,70],[71,73],[74,82],[83,89],[90,93],[94,98],[99,102],[103,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,125],[126,130],[131,136],[137,140],[141,146],[147,154],[155,161],[162,165],[166,176],[177,180],[181,186],[187,196],[197,202],[202,203],[204,212],[213,222],[223,225],[226,229],[230,238],[239,248],[249,253],[254,259],[260,264],[265,276],[276,277],[278,282],[283,290],[291,294],[295,300],[300,301],[301,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,324],[325,333],[334,338],[339,343],[344,351],[351,352],[353,358],[359,366],[367,375],[376,381],[382,384],[385,391],[391,392],[393,401],[402,404],[405,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,422],[423,432],[433,441],[442,450],[450,451],[452,455],[456,461],[462,464],[465,473],[473,474],[475,480],[481,485],[486,492],[493,495],[496,502],[503,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,524],[524,525],[526,529],[530,531],[532,537],[538,542],[543,545],[546,554],[555,561],[561,562],[563,566],[567,572],[573,580],[581,582],[583,585],[586,594],[595,598],[599,605],[606,610],[611,612],[613,621],[622,625],[626,636],[637,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,666],[666,667],[668,671],[672,679],[680,683],[684,689],[690,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,712],[712,713],[714,718],[719,721],[722,727],[728,734],[735,745],[746,758],[759,762],[763,770],[771,781],[781,782],[783,786],[787,790],[791,796],[797,808],[809,817],[818,833],[834,837],[838,849],[849,850],[851,857],[858,869],[870,877],[878,881],[882,889],[890,892],[893,899],[900,905],[906,911],[912,914],[915,920],[921,931],[932,940],[941,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,962],[963,966],[967,977],[977,978],[979,982],[983,985],[986,996],[997,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1015],[1016,1020],[1020,1021],[1022,1029],[1030,1033],[1034,1043],[1043,1044],[1045,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1071],[1072,1074],[1075,1082],[1083,1085],[1086,1089],[1090,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1108],[1109,1111],[1112,1116],[1116,1117],[1118,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1137],[1138,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1168],[1169,1174],[1175,1178],[1179,1187],[1188,1195],[1196,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1235],[1235,1236],[1237,1242],[1243,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1265,1266],[1267,1274],[1275,1278],[1279,1291],[1292,1294],[1295,1302],[1303,1305],[1306,1309],[1310,1316],[1316,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1348],[1349,1356],[1356,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1368,1369],[1370,1373],[1374,1376],[1377,1380],[1381,1387],[1388,1390],[1391,1396],[1397,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1418],[1419,1426],[1426,1427]],"answers":[],"uuid":"b5e6efbccbf6feb8dddbbce8d"},"15":{"context":"The Norman dynasty had a major political, cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East.

The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.","question":"What principality did William the conquerer found?","spans":[[0,3],[4,10],[11,18],[19,22],[23,24],[25,30],[31,40],[40,41],[42,50],[51,54],[55,63],[64,70],[71,73],[74,82],[83,89],[90,93],[94,98],[99,102],[103,107],[108,112],[112,113],[114,117],[118,125],[126,130],[131,136],[137,140],[141,146],[147,154],[155,161],[162,165],[166,176],[177,180],[181,186],[187,196],[197,202],[202,203],[204,212],[213,222],[223,225],[226,229],[230,238],[239,248],[249,253],[254,259],[260,264],[265,276],[276,277],[278,282],[283,290],[291,294],[295,300],[300,301],[301,308],[309,317],[318,320],[321,324],[325,333],[334,338],[339,343],[344,351],[351,352],[353,358],[359,366],[367,375],[376,381],[382,384],[385,391],[391,392],[393,401],[402,404],[405,411],[412,418],[418,419],[420,422],[423,432],[433,441],[442,450],[450,451],[452,455],[456,461],[462,464],[465,473],[473,474],[475,480],[481,485],[486,492],[493,495],[496,502],[503,507],[508,511],[512,518],[519,524],[524,525],[526,529],[530,531],[532,537],[538,542],[543,545],[546,554],[555,561],[561,562],[563,566],[567,572],[573,580],[581,582],[583,585],[586,594],[595,598],[599,605],[606,610],[611,612],[613,621],[622,625],[626,636],[637,649],[650,652],[653,659],[660,666],[666,667],[668,671],[672,679],[680,683],[684,689],[690,694],[695,698],[699,704],[705,712],[712,713],[714,718],[719,721],[722,727],[728,734],[735,745],[746,758],[759,762],[763,770],[771,781],[781,782],[783,786],[787,790],[791,796],[797,808],[809,817],[818,833],[834,837],[838,849],[849,850],[851,857],[858,869],[870,877],[878,881],[882,889],[890,892],[893,899],[900,905],[906,911],[912,914],[915,920],[921,931],[932,940],[941,946],[947,949],[950,953],[954,962],[963,966],[967,977],[977,978],[979,982],[983,985],[986,996],[997,999],[1000,1006],[1007,1009],[1010,1015],[1016,1020],[1020,1021],[1022,1029],[1030,1033],[1034,1043],[1043,1044],[1045,1048],[1049,1051],[1052,1055],[1056,1062],[1063,1071],[1072,1074],[1075,1082],[1083,1085],[1086,1089],[1090,1096],[1097,1099],[1100,1108],[1109,1111],[1112,1116],[1116,1117],[1118,1124],[1125,1133],[1134,1137],[1138,1146],[1147,1156],[1157,1163],[1164,1168],[1169,1174],[1175,1178],[1179,1187],[1188,1195],[1196,1198],[1199,1202],[1203,1211],[1212,1218],[1219,1221],[1222,1225],[1226,1230],[1231,1235],[1235,1236],[1237,1242],[1243,1248],[1249,1255],[1256,1264],[1265,1266],[1267,1274],[1275,1278],[1279,1291],[1292,1294],[1295,1302],[1303,1305],[1306,1309],[1310,1316],[1316,1317],[1318,1320],[1321,1329],[1330,1333],[1334,1339],[1340,1342],[1343,1348],[1349,1356],[1356,1357],[1358,1360],[1361,1368],[1368,1369],[1370,1373],[1374,1376],[1377,1380],[1381,1387],[1388,1390],[1391,1396],[1397,1403],[1404,1407],[1408,1411],[1412,1418],[1419,1426],[1426,1427]],"answers":[],"uuid":"e1b5fab52e5afa35bf1cfce1c"},"18":{"context":"Huguenot numbers peaked near an estimated two million by 1562, concentrated mainly in the southern and central parts of France, about one-eighth the number of French Catholics.
